## Description

This To-Do API is implemented following the **Pipeline Architecture** style. The application is structured around composable operations that are chained together to form pipelines, allowing for flexible and reusable business workflows.

## Layers

- **Presentation**  
  Responsible for handling input and output from external sources (e.g., HTTP requests). Includes Controllers and DTOs for transport.

- **Pipelines**  
  Defines the high-level orchestration of business logic. Each pipeline is composed of reusable operations executed in sequence.

- **Operations**  
  Encapsulates atomic units of business logic, such as validation, transformation, and persistence. These operations are designed to be modular and composable.

- **Persistence**  
  Declares interfaces (contracts) for interacting with storage layers.

- **Database**  
  Provides concrete implementations of persistence interfaces using specific storage mechanisms (e.g., in-memory).

- **Domain**  
  Contains the core business entities and value objects that represent the application's data and rules.


Each pipeline follows a **linear and explicit flow**, where data is progressively transformed and validated by chained operations.

However, this is far from being the most productive architectural style for designing an API like this. There's a little reuse, but the setting up is excessivily tiring and specific, and even reuse does not always occur.

Notice, for instance, the `UpdateTaskPipeline`, in which I expected to reuse directly the `GetTaskById` operation. Because the next steps required different types, I need to chain all operations mannually, instead of just using the `Pipeline` class.
